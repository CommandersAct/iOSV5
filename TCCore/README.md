<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>As we expended Commanders Act's mobile possibilities, it rapidly became apparent that we could not fit everything at the same time for everybody in only one big library. In fact, it's contradictory with Tag Management itself, so we decided to cut capabilities into smaller modules so people wouldn't need to add everything in their project, saving space in your application.</p>
<p>But even with that said, a part of our code is pretty useful in several of our modules, so we created a Core module to prevent code repetition and thus also bigger applications if you need several modules.</p>
<h1 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h1>
<p>The Core module is mandatory if you are using Commanders Act's mobile solution, so we simply put the dependencies needed for the Core module directly in the documentations of the other modules.</p>
<p>On iOS Core isn't compiling with any dependencies.</p>
